# bookmark.d v3

This is an update to my previous project that allowed users to add a bookmark via a form, saving the data in localStorage and giving them the ability to edit, delete and filter their saved bookmarks.

This version uses a graphql api to fetch data from cloud storage and will eventually allow for client-side pagination, user authentication and authorisation and file storage. 

Just an experiment working with end-to-end type safety.
